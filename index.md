## Current Projects

#### Vesuvius Challenge

The [Vesuvius Challenge](https://scrollprize.org/) is a machine learning and computer vision competition that aims to extract passages of never-before-seen text from inside an unopened (and unopenable) **carbonized scroll**. The goal is to use computer vision and image segmentation techniques to extract faded ink from X-rays and other medical scans of papyri that were carbonized during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.

#### Language Learning App
An app focused on grammar and vocabulary practice based on multiple choice questions (cloze). Starting with French and Spanish with translations provided in English. Currently working on a Flask implementation, which will then be ported into Flutter. Rough development draft follows.

#### News aggregator site
Currently setting up a news aggregator, to feature a rolling feed of breaking news in a 48-hour cycle.
